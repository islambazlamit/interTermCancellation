# InterTermCancellation
This code is designed to find the inter-terms cancellation between the non-linear PDEs terms numerically to be used in finding the bilinear systems associated with those systems. 
The code was used to find the inter-term cancellations for different versions of nonlinear Schrodinger equations  as a part of our systematic search method for finding Hirota bilinear systems of nonlinear evolution
equations. The code has two versions, one in C++, which is here, and the second in the Mathematica language. The C++ version is much faster and organized to cover more terms (up to 12 terms). 

The code was used in our research paper: Albazlamit, I., Al Sakkaf, L., & Al Khawaja, U. (2025). A Search Method for Hirota Bilinear Systems of Nonlinear Evolution Equations. Next Research, 100705. DOI: 10.1016/j.nexres.2025.100705


For more details on how to use the code, please refer to the paper "Albazlamit, Islam M., L. Y. Al Sakkaf, and U. Al Khawaja, “A search method for Hirota bilinear systems of nonlinear evolution equations.”".

The data in the output file represents the number of equations. By solving these equations, let's say by Mathematica, we get the general inter-term cancellations.
