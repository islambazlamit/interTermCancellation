# InterTermCancellation
This code is designed to find the inter-terms cancellation between the non-linear PDEs terms numerically to be used in finding the bilinear systems associated with those systems. 
The code was used to find the inter-term cancellations for different versions of nonlinear Schrodinger equations  as a part of our systematic search method for finding Hirota bilinear systems of nonlinear evolution
equations. The code has two versions, one in C++, which is here, and the second in the Mathematica language. The C++ version is much faster and organized to cover more terms (up to 12 terms). 

The code was used in our research paper: Albazlamit, Islam M., L. Y. Al Sakkaf, and U. Al Khawaja, “A search method for Hirota bilinear systems of nonlinear evolution equations.”
